  shadow budget
description:

  Detailed AOP budgets from DPs are needed by the MOHs to inform resource allocations for the next fiscal year. As MTEF reporting categories are limited, the MOHs construct a Shadow Budget that sets out sector requirements, funds expected from GOK and generated revenue (e.g. user fees, CDF, LAFT), and resources expected from DPs both "on-budget" and "off-budget".

  To identify critical funding gaps, the Shadow Budget requires information on planned inputs by level of service (health facilities L1-6, and MOH or central level) and type of service provider (GOK or private), programme area (e.g. specific MOH support systems or technical programme area), and geographic area. Funding gaps identified in the Shadow Budget will help form the basis for GOK resource allocations, and for negotiations with DPs on allocation of "off-budget" resources.

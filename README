What version of Rails should we use?

Let @RwandaOnRails know and we'll centralize that somewhere / use
the google group.

Using Rails 3 would help give back to contributors by letting them learn
and it has nice improvements. 

Cons are some plugins that could be really useful for getting an alpha
that's nice for low effort, e.g. active_scaffold, but might be less optimal
long term. We just need to get something together quickly.

I (@gregLnelson) think 2.3.5 is the way to go for plugin usage for quickly
building alpha.

@p_elliott can add you if I'm not around. I'm flying to London early today.
Thanks to Paul for being interested on a surely hoppin' Friday night.

Is there a reason to not make everyone an owner? Would be nice if anyone
could add anyone they knew that was interested in helping.

Google group called rwanadaonrails.

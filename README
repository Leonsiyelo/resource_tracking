Currently getting an alpha / minimum viable product done. This should be fairly easy, it's mostly CRUD. After that, we can better focus on working with the local development team.

Most helpful feature to work on would be a tree interface for selecting codes for a project/activity/line item, along with fields to enter amounts or %'s for that code. No work has been done on that as of yet.

I'm going to integrate file uploading from http://github.com/rwandaonrails/csv-uploader.

Google group called rwanadaonrails.

Pivotal Tracker is at http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/59773
Tracker should be public at this point.
Email google group to get tracker access. @p_elliott can add you if I'm not around. I'll be flying to Rwanda in 3 hours.
Thanks to Paul for being interested on a surely hoppin' Friday night and tweeting for more info.

Please fork and take a feature for the alpha. More info on collaborating with local team coming on Monday.

Let me know if you're available on Tuesday to do some pairing/mentoring! Mega bonus points.

We may switch to Rails 3 after we have some alpha working.

Nothing is sacred, be vocal about ways to improve anything we are doing.

Currently getting an alpha / minimum viable product done. This should be fairly easy, it's mostly CRUD. After that, we can better focus on working with the local development team.

Most helpful feature to work on would be a tree interface for selecting codes for a project/activity/line item, along with fields to enter amounts or %'s for that code. No work has been done on that as of yet.

I'm going to integrate file uploading from http://github.com/rwandaonrails/csv-uploader.

Google group called rwanadaonrails.

Pivotal Tracker is at http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/59773
Tracker should be public at this point. Click the "Join Project" button after visiting this website to get more than read access.

Please fork and take a feature for the alpha. More info on collaborating with local team can be got by emailing gregory_nelson@abtassoc.com.

Let me know if you're available to do some pairing/mentoring! Mega bonus points.

We may switch to Rails 3 after we have some alpha working.

Nothing is sacred, be vocal about ways to improve anything we are doing.

DEV INSTRUCTIONS TO GET UP AND RUNNING
-----------------
Goal here is to standardize the Ruby and Gem environments across Developers on the project and help new devs get up and running quickly.
* fork and clone git repo
* cd resource_tracking
* install RVM if not already installed, see http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/
* rvm install ree
* rvm ree-1.8.7-2010.01

Option (1) manually create gemset and install gems
* rvm gemset create rails238
* gem install rails -v 2.3.8
# install db driver per your environment, I use mysql
* gem install mysql

Option (2) import gemset from default.gems.  Recommended.  Requires we maintain/update exported file default.gems as new gem dependencies are added (use 'rvm gemset export')
* rvm --create ree-1.8.7-2010.01@rails238
* rvm gemset import rails238

# cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
# edit config/datbase.yml per your environment.  This file is not tracked by git.
# create .rvmrc file so whenever we cd to RAILS_ROOT of this project in the future we are using the right Ruby version and Gem set.
* echo 'rvm ree-1.8.7-2010.01@rails238' > .rvmrc
* rake db:create
* rake db:migrate
* script/server

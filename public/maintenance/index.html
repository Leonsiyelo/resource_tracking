    <h1>Server Maintenance</h1>
    <p>Update Posted at 8:45 Kigali time</p>
    <p>We are making changes to the web site's database needed to improve it. This involves downloading the database, running a program to change it, and uploading it back to the server. Due to a slow connection, we received the full database later than expected and decided to do extra checks to make sure no data had been lost, which has delayed updating of the site. The updates to the database are nearly complete and we are moving to another location to upload it more quickly. We expect the database to be online not later than 10am. We apologize for the inconvenience. Feel free to contact gregory_nelson@abtassoc.com with any questions, concerns, or help with data entry.</p>

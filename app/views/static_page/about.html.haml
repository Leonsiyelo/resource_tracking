%h1 About The Health Resource Tracker
.text
  %p The Government of Rwanda recently inaugurated an innovative and ambitious initiative to harmonize all health resource tracking systems in the country. The key goals of this initiative are to foster better planning and coordination between all development partners, as well as to increase financial accountability in the health sector, both of which are ideals enshrined in the Paris Declaration.

  %p To appreciate the value of Rwanda’s efforts, it is worth considering the current state of resource tracking in the developing world. Monitoring systems for tracking resource flows in the health sector are varied and serve multiple functions. Some track disease-specific resources, while others measure all health flows. Some are forward-looking and measure planned expenditure, while others take stock of actual spending in past years. Together, these resource tracking tools are essential for ensuring that international donors are coordinating their efforts and honoring their aid commitments, and that developing countries are meeting spending targets. Moreover, they serve as essential ingredients for health sector reviews that assess the effectiveness of current investments, and have become key inputs for health sector planning exercises. While each of these resource tracking tools serves a valuable function in its own right and caters to the needs of specific development partners, they collectively place a heavy burden on stakeholders in terms of the time and resources it takes to report, collect, and analyze the data needed for each. There is frequently considerable overlap in the data that they collect and their schedules are not coordinated with one another or the planning and budgeting cycle of the country.

  %p While many countries have recognized the need for streamlining resource tracking exercises and have taken initial steps in this direction, Rwanda is the first country in the world to undertake a comprehensive review of all existing resource tracking tools and to make the harmonization of them into one resource tracking system a key national priority.  The initiative aims to rationalize data collection so as to avoid any duplication of effort and reduce the overall time and money spent on resource tracking. Furthermore, the individual tools will be made comparable by harmonizing the definitions and classifications that they use. Alongside the harmonization initiative, the Government of Rwanda is also taking action to build the capacity of local academic institutions to both undertake resource tracking and train the next generation of public health officials in resource tracking methods.

  %p Collectively, these efforts will lead to resource tracking becoming easier, quicker, and less expensive for Rwanda to produce and use, which in turn will serve to institutionalize resource tracking in the country. In the realm of health resource tracking, Rwanda is well on its way to becoming a shining example that other countries in Africa and around the world will soon want to emulate.
  %p The Health Resource Tracking Database lies at the heart of Rwanda’s effort to harmonize resource tracking. The goal of the database is to track financial flows in the health sector. It has been designed to capture both planned and realized expenditures by all development partners. The reporting is done in terms of activities or projects, which the partners both describe and code according to a common classification system that can serve the needs of several resource tracking frameworks and tools such as the National Health Accounts, the National AIDS Spending Assessment, and the Joint Annual Work Plan. Further more, the data is collected at the district-level, which allows for detailed planning, budgeting, and accounting.
  %p In coming years, the goal is to expand this platform further to track additional financial information that is needed by development stakeholders in Rwanda as well as performance indicators that can be used to monitor gains from investments made.

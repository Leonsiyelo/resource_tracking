  %h3 What's a Project?
  %p Projects are high-level health programs that your organization implements.
  %p A project is generally defined as a contractual agreement with a funding provider or oversight body to support health goals in your country.
  %br
  %h3 How do I add more detail?
  %p In the Health Resource Tracker, you can break-down your Projects into of several smaller, more detailed, Activities.
  %p For example if your project is (sub)implemented by multiple entities, you can create one or more Activities to represent this.

Feature: NGO/donor can enter activities for each project 
  In order to increase the quality of information reported
  As a NGO/Donor
  I want to be able to break down projects into activities

@activities
Scenario: See list of activities for my project
  Given a basic org + reporter profile, with data response, signed in
  When I go to the activities page
  Then I should see "Activities" within "h2"

@activities
@pending
Scenario: Add an activity
Scenario: Remove an activity
Scenario: Add activity across multiple projects

  # Transactional fixtures accelerate your tests by wrapping each test method
  # in a transaction that's rolled back on completion.  This ensures that the
  # test database remains unchanged so your fixtures don't have to be reloaded
  # between every test method.  Fewer database queries means faster tests.

  # Every Active Record database supports transactions except MyISAM tables
  # in MySQL.  Turn off transactional fixtures in this case; however, if you
  # don't care one way or the other, switching from MyISAM to InnoDB tables
  # is recommended.
  #
  # The only drawback to using transactional fixtures is when you actually 
  # need to test transactions.  Since your test is bracketed by a transaction,
  # any transactions started in your code will be automatically rolled back.

  # then set this back to true.
